# External-Tox-Saver
A tool for externalizing your tox files. 


## Usage
Bring "Release/External-Tox-Saver.tox" into your project. Press the "Retrieve External" button on the component's "system" page.
This will generate two pages with custom parameters. Select the "Toggles" page and toggle on the tox you want to save.  Then just save the project like normal, ctrl+s or save in the file menu, and it will save the tox. You can open the textport which will print out what has been saved or if there were any errors.

## Backup
This will automatically generate a backup folder next to every tox saved. It adds a timestamp. You can set the max number of backups in the System page as well. This just deletes the older file when you save it.
