# External-Tox-Saver
A tool for externalizing your tox files. 


## Usage
Bring "Release/External-Tox-Saver.tox" into your project. Press the "Retrieve External" button on the component's "system" page.
This will generate two pages with custom parameters. Select the "Toggles" page and toggle on the tox you want to save.  Then just hit save like normal and it will save the tox. You can open the textport which will print out what has been saved or if there were any errors.
