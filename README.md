Embody puts your ideas on screen as fast as you can describe them. Operators, connections, parameters, the works. Want to try a different direction? Spin up a new approach in seconds. Compare attempts side by side. Branch off the one that works. **The tool keeps up with you, instead of the other way around.**

## Three Tools, One Idea

**Envoy** — *forward velocity.* An embedded [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server lets [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), and [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/) talk directly to your live TouchDesigner session. Create operators, wire them up, set parameters, write extensions, debug errors — by saying what you want. No copy-pasting code. No describing your network in chat. Idea → operators in seconds.

**Embody** — *lateral velocity.* Tag any operator and Embody externalizes it to files on disk that mirror your network hierarchy. Try a new direction, branch off a good one, restore the state from yesterday — all in seconds. Your externalized files are the source of truth, so every project opens already in flow.

**TDN** — *the substrate that makes both possible.* TouchDesigner networks exported as human-readable YAML. The format is what lets your AI agent understand what's on the screen, what lets you diff one attempt against another, and what lets a network reconstruct itself from text on the next project open. TDN is what makes the rest of this possible.

| | What | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| 🤖 | **Envoy MCP Server** | 49 tools let your AI assistant build, wire, parameterize, and debug live networks. The first time you watch it happen, you stop typing operator names by hand for good. |
| 📄 | **TDN Network Format** | Networks become text. Diff two versions, revisit any version, hand an LLM a complete picture of what's on screen — all from a single `.tdn` file. |
| 📦 | **Automatic Restoration** | Externalized operators rebuild themselves from disk on every project open. The `.toe` is no longer the source of truth — your files are. |
| 📤 | **Portable Tox Export** | Pull any COMP out as a self-contained `.tox` with external references stripped. Ship a piece of your project anywhere. |

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Project Setup

Embody writes externalized files relative to your `.toe` location — no special folder structure required. Embody works in any project folder; if you happen to use git, every change is also a clean diff for free.

```
my-project/              ← project folder (optionally a git repo)
├── my-project.toe       ← your TouchDesigner project
├── base1/               ← externalized operators
│   ├── base2.tox        ← COMP (TOX strategy)
│   ├── base3.tdn        ← COMP (TDN strategy — diffable YAML)
│   └── text1.py         ← DAT
└── ...
```

### 2. Install and Tag

1. **Download** the Embody `.tox` from [`/release`](release/) and drag it into your TouchDesigner project
2. **Tag operators** — select any COMP or DAT and press `lctrl` twice to tag and externalize it
3. **Work normally** — press `ctrl + shift + u` to update all externalizations, or `ctrl + alt + u` to update only the current COMP. On project open, Embody restores everything from disk automatically

> **Tip:** If no operators are tagged, Embody will externalize all eligible COMPs and DATs, which may slow down complex projects. Tagging selectively is recommended.

### 3. Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `lctrl + lctrl` | Tag or manage the operator under the cursor |
| `ctrl + shift + u` | Update all externalizations |
| `ctrl + alt + u` | Update only the current COMP |
| `ctrl + shift + r` | Refresh tracking state |
| `ctrl + shift + o` | Open the Manager UI |
| `ctrl + shift + e` | Export entire project to `.tdn` file |
| `ctrl + alt + e` | Export current COMP to `.tdn` file |

## Envoy MCP Server

Embody includes **Envoy**, an embedded [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that gives AI coding assistants direct access to your live TouchDesigner session.

### Setup

1. **Enable Envoy** — toggle the `Envoyenable` parameter on the Embody COMP
2. **Server starts** on `localhost:9870` (configurable via `Envoyport`)
3. **Auto-configuration** — Envoy creates a `.mcp.json` in your git repo root
4. **Connect** — open a Claude Code session (or restart your IDE) in the repo root — it picks up `.mcp.json` automatically

If your project isn't in a git repo, add `.mcp.json` manually to your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "envoy": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:9870/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Tools at a Glance

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `create_op` | Create any operator type in any network |
| `set_parameter` | Set values, expressions, or bind modes on any parameter |
| `connect_ops` | Wire operators together |
| `execute_python` | Run arbitrary Python in TD's main thread |
| `export_network` | Export networks to diffable `.tdn` YAML |
| `create_extension` | Scaffold a full extension (COMP + DAT + wiring) |
| `get_op_errors` | Inspect errors on any operator and its children |

...and 37 more. See the [full tools reference](https://dylanroscover.github.io/Embody/envoy/tools-reference/).

When Envoy starts, it generates a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root with TD development patterns, the complete MCP tool reference, and project-specific guidance.

## TDN Network Format

TDN (TouchDesigner Network) is the file format that makes the rest of Embody possible. It exports an entire operator network — operators, connections, parameters, layout, annotations, DAT content — as a single human-readable YAML file. Your AI agent can read it. You can read it. Any text tool can diff it. The network can rebuild itself from it on the next project open.

This is the substrate. Every other capability — AI-driven building, version control, automatic restoration — builds on top of it.

- **Entire project**: `ctrl + shift + e`
- **Current COMP**: `ctrl + alt + e`
- **Via Envoy**: `export_network` / `import_network` MCP tools

See the [full TDN specification](https://dylanroscover.github.io/Embody/tdn/specification/) for format details, import process, and round-trip guarantees.

<details>
<summary><strong>Logging</strong></summary>

Embody provides a multi-destination logging system:

- **File logging** (default): `dev/logs/<project_name>_YYMMDD.log`, auto-rotates at 10 MB
- **FIFO DAT**: Recent entries visible in the TD network editor
- **Textport**: Enable the `Print` parameter to echo logs
- **Ring buffer**: Last 200 entries via the Envoy `get_logs` MCP tool

```python
op.Embody.Log('Something happened', 'INFO')
op.Embody.Warn('Check this out')
op.Embody.Error('Something broke')
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Testing</strong></summary>

Embody includes **72 test suites** (1,693 tests) covering core externalization, MCP tools, TDN format, the Envoy server/bridge, and palette catalogs. Tests run inside TouchDesigner using a custom test runner with sandbox isolation.

```python
op.unit_tests.RunTests()                              # All tests (non-blocking)
op.unit_tests.RunTests(suite_name='test_path_utils')   # Single suite
op.unit_tests.RunTestsSync()                           # All in one frame (blocks TD)
```

Via Envoy MCP: use the `run_tests` tool. See the [full testing docs](https://dylanroscover.github.io/Embody/testing/) for coverage details and how to write new tests.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></summary>

- **Timeline Paused**: Embody requires the timeline to be running. An error appears if paused.
- **Clone/Replicant Operators**: Cannot be externalized. Embody warns if you try to tag them.
- **Engine COMPs**: Engine, time, and annotate COMPs are not supported for externalization.

## Version History

See the [full changelog](https://dylanroscover.github.io/Embody/changelog/) for detailed version history.

**Recent releases:**

- **6.0.44**: Community specimens paste in LIVE and working. The safe-import was zeroing EVERY parameter expression (a published specimen's GLSL uniform bindings, resolution, and animation drivers all collapsed to 0 -- a dead frame), so it now preserves provably-pure value expressions (par reads, `absTime`, `math.*`, `Par.eval()`, arithmetic) via a new AST allowlist and disarms only genuinely side-effecting surfaces; a clean specimen pastes with no warning (live-if-scanned-clean). Fixes the scanner false positives on `.eval()`/`.store()`/`tdu`/GLSL DATs, trusts TD palette extensions (with an `opshortcut`-hijack defense), and closes adjacent holes (Script OPs bypassed, `tox_ref` stripped, cooking suspended during untrusted import). Paste UX: the new COMP auto-selects and the view pans to centre it (via writable `pane.x/y`), and the auto-paste prompt fires only while the TD window is the OS-frontmost app (NSWorkspace / GetForegroundWindow). New `test_collection_pure` (14) + standalone `test_safe_import_pure` (25) + a 70-case validator corpus. Test suite **72 suites / 1,693 tests**.
- **6.0.42**: Clipboard auto-paste -- bring a TDN into your network with no keyboard shortcut. The conflicting Cmd-Shift-V paste binding is removed (TD's native operator-clipboard paste fires on the same keystroke and can't be suppressed, pasting leftover nodes). Instead Embody watches the OS clipboard (`ui.clipboard`) and, when a TDN network appears (web "embody it" button or Cmd-Shift-C), prompts to **Embody it** into the current network as a new COMP -- debounced, gated on a new Clipboard Auto-Paste toggle, skipped in Perform Mode, and suppressed during saves/tests. `test_clipboard_watch` (5); no regression. Test suite **71 suites / 1,678 tests**.
- **6.0.41**: The git-uncommitted status axis -- a second manager status axis (after diff_tdn in 6.40), completing the v5.0.437 feature set on the v6 line. Externalized files saved to disk but not yet committed to git now show a distinct **orange** Strategy badge, kept separate from the red "unsaved" axis. An async `git status --porcelain` worker scan (no frame drop, `--no-optional-locks`) maps changes to op paths and stores them at runtime; a `changed` filter keyword shows rows with pending changes on either axis; a shipped refresh-after-commit rule clears the badges after a commit. The `Uncommittedcolor` param (already in v6) is now wired. `test_git_status` (20 tests); full data path verified live. Test suite **70 suites / 1,673 tests**, all green.
- **6.0.40**: The diff_tdn release. Re-integrates the **`diff_tdn` MCP tool** (what is UNSAVED in a TDN network -- the live network vs the on-disk `.tdn`, the view git can't give -- one COMP or the whole project) and its companion **`.tdn` git textconv driver** (keeps committed `.tdn` diffs clean by stripping the volatile export header) from v5.0.437 into v6's YAML v2.0 world. The textconv is now YAML-aware and the Embody venv carries **PyYAML** so git's diff driver no longer silently falls back to a raw, noisy diff; the diff engine reconciles a legacy v1.5 array `dat_content` with the v2.0 string form. `get_externalizations` / `get_externalization_status` now hint `recommended_tool: diff_tdn`. A 4-lens adversarial panel caught two real regressions pre-merge (a dropped `_get_externalizations` enrichment; four broken setup-environment tests), both fixed and verified. Test suite **69 suites / 1,653 tests**, all green.
- **6.0.39**: The save-resilience release. **The Envoy liveness watchdog now actually self-heals a save-time wedge** — its revive cooldown measured a ~2s anti-spam window in `absTime.frame` (frames since app launch, resets to 0 each launch) but *stored* that value in COMP storage, which persists into the `.toe`/`.tdn`; a high frame baked from a prior session made every revive compute a negative `now - stored` delta (always "< 2s ago"), so `_reviveDeadServer` returned **before scheduling the restart, every time, permanently** — the watchdog detected the wedge forever but couldn't fix it (MCP stayed down after a save until a manual toggle). The cooldown now uses `time.monotonic()` on an instance attribute (never `absTime.frame`, never storage) and `__init__` scrubs the obsolete `_last_revive_frame`; verified on a real save — the Envoy drop self-heals in ~1s. The watchdog also now **trusts the socket, not `_init_complete`/`_starting`** (both reset by a save, which used to idle the tick on a dead server), and **`Start()` probes the socket before trusting a stale "Running"** status. **The "Enable Envoy?" onboarding modal no longer fires during a save or test** — a single `_suppressDialogs()` predicate (test run active OR save in progress) gates the `Verify()` queue site, the deferred `_promptEnvoy`, and `_messageBox`, with a `_suppress_dialogs` save-window flag scrubbed on next open; the file-cleanup and deprecated-externaltox prompts are gated the same way. Plus **169 new v6 tests across 9 suites** (clipboard copy/paste 42, collection scanner 22 + safe-import 18, v6 hardening 20, specimen publish 19, the watchdog 21, GLSL externalize 11, layout lint 10, dialog suppression 6) and a **layout-lint `maxDepth` fix** (the v6.0.34 lint used `findChildren(depth=12)` — exactly depth 12, matched nothing). Test suite **67 suites / 1,616 tests**, all green.
- **6.0.34**: Everything since v6.0.26 in one release. **GLSL shader DATs now externalize as `.glsl`, not `.py`** — `EmbodyExt._externalizeDATs` inferred the tag from a bare `dat_type_to_tag` map (`['text']='Pytag'`), so shaders (type `text`, language `glsl`) were written as Python; it now resolves the tag from DAT *content* via `_inferDATTagValue`, and the 8 newer Specimens' 42 shaders were re-externalized to `.glsl`. **Layout lint at the Envoy tool layer** — `execute_python` (raw `comp.create()`/`.copy()`, no auto-position) was the recurring source of ops piled at (0,0); Envoy now snapshots the op tree before your code runs and emits a `LAYOUT WARNING` on the response when the call leaves ops at (0,0), overlapping, or with docked DATs >500u from their host (`_lintLayout`/`_lintNewOps`), with `network-layout.md` + template DRY'd around the enforcement. **Specimen publish hook** (`specimen_publish.py`) — a project `onProjectPostSave` hook exports each manifest Specimen self-contained (DAT scripts embedded) to `specimens/<tdn_path>` for the embody.tools "embody it" copy-paste, skipping unchanged files. **Waveform-stack feedback fix** — broke a Feedback-TOP cook-dependency loop by seeding from outside the loop (`res_fb`) and grabbing the frame-delayed state from its Target TOP. Plus six landscape transmission specimens (essence-streams, vertical-fibers, crosspoint, waveform-stack, packet-fabric, hyper_ntsc; reaction-diffusion landscaped). Test suite **58 suites / 1,439 tests**, no regressions.
- **6.0.26**: A correctness + efficiency release. **TDN custom-parameter values now round-trip** — exporting a COMP with custom parameters and re-importing reset every value to 0/min (the exporter omits a value equal to its default, but the importer set `.default` and never `.val`), which broke *every parametric specimen* on import; fixed with a default→value fallback in `_setCustomParValues` plus 6 regression tests. **The save-time watchdog log storm is gone** — a `project.save()` reinitializes EnvoyExt in a rapid same-frame burst, and ~4s later all the armed liveness-watchdog ticks came due in one frame and each revived + logged ("MCP socket on port None unreachable — reviving server" ×18-21 per save); a monotonic generation token collapses the leftover tick loops on the next reinit, and a frame-cooldown in `_reviveDeadServer` collapses the same-frame burst to one log + one revive (verified on a real save: 21 → 1), with the genuine self-heal preserved. **The pre-save "TDN Content at Risk" dialog no longer fires on annotated specimens** — the content-safety scan was walking *into* palette-clone COMPs (an annotateCOMP's button `help` tables) and flagging their regenerable internals as user content at risk, so every TDN-tagged COMP containing an annotation popped the dialog on each save; both scans now skip anything inside a palette clone (verified live, 11 at-risk → 0). **MCP token-efficiency pass** — tool *results* stay in context, so four changes cut response size: the per-response `_logs` piggyback is now WARNING/ERROR-only (was up to 20 routine-INFO entries on every call), `run_tests` returns counts + failures only (drops ~1,400 PASS objects), `export_network` to a file returns a compact summary instead of echoing the whole `.tdn`, and `capture_top` returns the file path by default (pass `inline=true` for an embedded preview). **Murmuration** joins the Specimen Collection (4th) — a dense GPU particle swarm flocking like a starling murmuration at dusk: true per-neighbor Reynolds (a Neighbor POP index list iterated in a GLSL POP for cohesion/alignment/inverse-square separation), a moving attractor, curl-noise, soft containment + drag, rendered as additive point sprites with a dusk speed-ramp + bloom. **The TDN clipboard Copy/Paste loop is now complete** — `Cmd-Shift-C` copies the selected COMP (v6.0.11 shipped paste but never wired copy — its "Copy button" never existed), `Cmd-Shift-V` now also accepts a raw `.tdn` file's text (sandboxed/inert, since bare text has no provenance — `ImportNetworkFromFile` is the trusted/direct path for local files), the clipboard envelope is pretty-printed, and a pasted COMP is named from its `network_path` basename instead of `pasted_tdn`. **POP point-sequence import fixed** — `op.seq['pt']` subscript returns `None` for POP sequences, so importing a `pt` sequence silently dropped its points; resolution now iterates. Plus `test_tdn_file_io`/`test_tdn_helpers` were updated for TDN v2.0 YAML (33 tests red since the v2.0 migration, now green). Test suite **57 suites / 1,439 tests**, all green.
- **6.0.16**: The on-disk `.tdn` format graduates to **TDN v2.0: YAML**. A network now serializes as a single self-contained YAML document instead of JSON, so a `.tdn` reads top-to-bottom like the network it describes. Multi-line `dat_content` (GLSL, Python, any `textDAT` script) is stored as a plain string rendered as a YAML literal block scalar (`|`) — source reads like code with no escaped newlines and diffs line-by-line (this reverts the v1.5 array-of-lines workaround). Round-trips are byte-exact (trailing newlines preserved via `|`/`|-`/`|+` chomping) and deterministic (no key reorder, no anchors), so re-saving an unchanged network produces no diff. **Legacy JSON `.tdn` still import** — importers parse json-first (BOM/whitespace stripped), so back-compat is independent of any YAML C library and tab-indented legacy files load losslessly; migration is lazy (rewritten on next save). Auto-created default docked compute DATs are no longer serialized (TD recreates them on import), and with the YAML representation files are roughly **17% smaller**. MIME type is now `application/yaml`. Docs (spec, examples, schema guide, supported formats) rewritten for v2.0.
- **6.0.11**: Envoy's MCP connection now self-heals across saves and reinits — the end of "connected:false while TouchDesigner is still running". A liveness watchdog tied to the EnvoyExt instance lifetime (armed from `__init__`, one loop per instance) probes the socket every ~4s and revives Envoy whenever it's enabled-but-down — a dead socket, or a `project.save()` / extension reinit that took the server down — force-freeing port 9870 if it's still held and rebinding in ~1s, with no restart and no manual toggle. The prior `Start()`-armed watchdog missed the save case: a mid-save reinit suppresses the old server thread's exit callback (no auto-restart) and can skip or race the new instance's auto-start, orphaning a `Start()`-only watchdog. Verified — a live-listener kill self-heals in ~6s, and three consecutive `project.save()` cycles each fired the watchdog (`running=False`), force-freed the held port, and rebound in ~1s. Plus: **TDN clipboard Copy/Paste** (the **Copy tdn** button writes a portable `_embody_tdn` envelope; **Ctrl+Shift+V** pastes it as a new COMP), with **community TDN** (`embody.tools` source) scanned and defaulted **inert** — Execute DATs disarmed, expressions neutralized, IO bypassed, storage stripped, content preserved — via a `CollectionExt` extension and self-contained scanner / safe-import DATs (clipboard logic now lives inside the Embody COMP, portable in the `.tox`). New always-loaded **`performance.md`** rule (metric-gating protocol + wiki-cited crash-cause table + safe-default caps) and **`visual-aesthetics`** skill (objective composition / value / color / contrast / motion / finishing + a mandatory `capture_top` preview-and-judge loop); preview-and-judge reinforced across create-/debug-operator, mcp-tools-reference, and CLAUDE.md; `td-connectivity` documents the watchdog; `network-layout` hardened against the `execute_python` / `.create()` (0, 0) bypass — all deployed to user projects via the template map. First v6 Embody/Envoy changelog entry (earlier v6.0.x builds were the embody.tools platform under `platform/`).
- **5.0.429**: A friendlier "Duplicate Path Detected" dialog. New **`Template Master Name`** parameter (`Templatemaster`, default `__template__`): when a group of operators sharing one external path has **exactly one** whose path contains that name as a whole segment (e.g. a `__template__` parent COMP), it's auto-selected as master and the rest tagged `clone` with no prompt — the durable fix for the common template-plus-runtime-copies pattern (a `scene_<id>` chain each carrying the template's externalized DATs). Opt-in by convention (projects not using the name are unaffected; set your own like `_master`, or clear to always choose manually); matches a whole segment not a substring, and only on an unambiguous single match. The manual prompt no longer shows N identical same-named buttons — each is now labeled by the **differing** path segment, numbered to the dialog body (`1: __template__`, `2: scene_1exalohf`, …) — and groups larger than 5 operators get a **Keep first as master / Dismiss** strategy prompt instead of an unreadable button row. Test suite **57 suites / 1,413 tests** (+12), all green.
- **5.0.428**: Everything since v5.0.414 in one release. Headline is **`tdn_exclude`** — a `Tdnexcludetag` parameter (default `tdn_exclude`) that makes a COMP invisible to the TDN system (never exported, stripped, or reconstructed), the durable opt-out for app-managed children under cascade-autotag (runtime `op.copy()` content like Moonshine's `proj_<id>` chains). Exclusion is honored at a TDN boundary's direct children; a COMP tagged but nested under a non-excluded intermediate is **serialized as normal content and preserved** (with a warning) rather than silently lost. **TDN dirty detection rebuilt**: the fingerprint captures each operator's non-default *authored* parameter values (`expr`/`bindExpr`/`val`, never `par.eval()`), so a parameter edit flags a TDN COMP dirty while a dependency-driven change to a live expression's *evaluated* value (animation, audio, a moving CHOP) does **not** — no more perpetual re-export churn on animated COMPs. The sweep is consolidated to one fingerprint per Refresh (was two) for a real frame-time win on large networks; `DirtyCount` reads the fingerprint result instead of the always-True `oper.dirty`; a reverted edit clears the dirty flag. **Envoy resilience**: startup status waits for a real bind handshake before reading "Running" (no optimistic lie, including uvicorn `SystemExit`); `restart_td` validates real non-zombie `TouchDesigner` PIDs via `ps`; the status moved into the window header, prefixed "Envoy". **Three issue #21 crash fixes** hardened across the whole table-read surface: `captureParameters` can't crash on broken expressions (authored read, no eval), `_cellVal` guards every externalizations-table read (and warns on genuine row-level corruption), and `onProjectPreSave` is fail-safe end-to-end so a hook exception can't truncate the `.toe`. Plus: the "TDN Content at Risk" dialog gains a persistent **Always Skip**; `externalizations.tsv` no longer churns phantom timestamp rows per save; a calmer first-launch palette scan; the manager expand/collapse glyph on top-level rows; a duplicate-BOM fix in `WindowHeaderExt`; an AI-first Quickstart page; MCP tool count reconciled to 48. A final 7-angle regression review of the branch caught and fixed the live-expression churn, the nested-exclude data loss, the always-dirty count, the stuck dirty flag, the duplicate BOM, and the double sweep — each with a regression test. Verified by a fresh-install smoke test of the release `.tox`. Test suite **57 suites / 1,401 tests**, all green.
- **5.0.414**: Third value `Custom` for `AI Project Root` (follow-up to Ten0's feedback on issue #19) — paired with a new `AI Project Root (Custom)` Folder parameter that's greyed out unless the menu is set to `Custom`. The custom path can be absolute or relative to the `.toe` directory (e.g. `../`). For monorepos where multiple `.toe` files share a parent directory, each `.toe` sets the same relative path and they all converge on one `AGENTS.md` / `.claude/` / `.mcp.json` / `.embody/envoy.json` — which lets the multi-instance MCP feature work naturally across sibling projects. Flipping the menu or changing the path migrates Embody state and AI config to the new location, same atomic move + marker-aware cleanup as the gitroot↔projectfolder flip. Plus two defense fixes from earlier in the cycle: `_messageBox` no longer falls back to a real modal dialog when seeded test responses are exhausted (would freeze TD with stacked dialogs after a test run); `Verify()` won't re-queue the Envoy opt-in prompt while one is already pending (idempotent flag — multiple `Verify()` calls during a test's Disable/Enable cycle can no longer stack N prompts). `_findSettingsFile` got a walk-up fallback to handle the Custom-mode chicken-and-egg (saved custom path lives in `config.json` which can't be read until settings are restored — so walk up from the `.toe` looking for any `.embody/config.json`).
- **5.0.413**: Two independent bodies of work bundled into one build. **(1) Issue #20**: parent `.tdn` files no longer embed the contents of TOX-externalized child COMPs — emits a `tox_ref` pointer instead, mirroring the existing `tdn_ref` pattern; round-trip restoration handled by a new Phase 8.5 (`_restoreTOXShells`) that sets `externaltox` and calls `_reloadTox` after import. Plus `_validateTOXRefs` for cross-validation parity, the `_stripNestedTOXChildren` backward-compat path for pre-v1.4 files, and TDN format version bumped to 1.4 with the schema updated accordingly. **Envoy-toggle frame-drop fix** surfaced during diagnosis — `_findAvailablePort` was paying a 1.5s `time.sleep` on the main thread (108 frames at 60fps) whenever the preferred port was held by *any* listener, including foreign zombie TD processes the wait could never free. Now skips the wait when force-close has nothing of ours to close (caps at 500ms when it does), and branches directly to range-scan when the holder is a foreign live instance in our registry. Measured: Start time 1797ms → 346ms. **(2) `AI Project Root` parameter** (`gitroot` default / `projectfolder`) for monorepo setups where the TouchDesigner project lives in a subdirectory of a larger repo — flips Embody's AI/MCP config target between the git root and the `.toe` directory, with full migration of persistent state and marker-aware cleanup of the old root that preserves user-authored files. **Issue #19 fix** — the `Path.home()` length comparison in `_findProjectRoot`/`_findGitRoot`/`_checkOrInitGitRepo` bailed before searching when the project lived on a non-home drive (Windows D:\ with home on C:\), so subsequent runs failed to find `.git`, duplicated `.mcp.json` config, and broke the MCP connection. Also: registry I/O (`RefreshRegistry`, `_removeFromRegistry`, port-conflict detection) routes through `_findProjectRoot()` for consistency under `projectfolder` mode; `_atomicMove` helper (copy-to-tmp + `os.replace` + unlink) makes cross-filesystem catalog moves safe against partial writes; settings-restore checks both Aiprojectroot candidate roots; orphan-handling renames any leftover critical files after a failed migration to `.orphan` so fallback lookups don't pick up stale data; legacy file sweep removes old `.envoy.json`, `.embody.json`, `.envoy-tools-cache.json`, and `.claude/envoy-bridge.py` from previous Embody versions. 6 new tests; `test_tdn_file_io` 66 → 92.
- **5.0.407**: Critical Windows-only crash hotfix introduced by v5.0.402's registry GC. `_isPidAlive(pid)` was built on `os.kill(pid, 0)` — on Windows, CPython implements that as `OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS) + TerminateProcess(handle, sig)` for *all* sig values, so the "liveness check" literally told the OS to kill the process being checked. Any time `_writeEnvoyConfig`'s GC loop iterated `instances` and the row contained the running TD's own PID (which it does any time the project has been saved with Envoy enabled), the loop called `TerminateProcess(self_handle, 0)` and TD exited with code 0 — silent, no traceback, repro fingerprint matched perfectly. Replaced with safe `OpenProcess(SYNCHRONIZE)` pattern via ctypes (already in use by `envoy_bridge.is_process_alive`); SYNCHRONIZE access doesn't include termination rights. Also rewired the duplicate `os.kill` inside `_findAvailablePort` that would have killed any foreign live TD whose registry entry shared the port. Plus: `CatalogManager` palette scan now snapshots and restores `time.play`/`time.rate`/`cookRate`/`realTime` around each chunk so a misbehaving palette component (e.g. the refactored `Palette:logger v2.7.0` on TD 2025.32820) can't leave the timeline paused; `_verifyMcpImportable` short-circuits when `mcp.server` is already loaded instead of tearing down 82 submodules every toggle; bridge `find_all_td_pids()` filters CEF/Web Render helper subprocesses that were generating ~214k phantom "TD process detected" log lines per session; `_osLabel()` disambiguates Windows 11 from Windows 10 (both report NT 10.0 — discriminator is build ≥22000); `execute_src_ctrl` reads/writes README as UTF-8 so emoji don't crash the bumper on Windows non-UTF-8 code pages. 19 new tests across 3 new files. Test file count 50 → 53.
- **5.0.403**: Hotfix for v5.0.402 — `EmbodyExt.Update()` rename-detection used `self.ownerComp` (an EnvoyExt-only attribute) instead of `self.my`. Every Update tick during a save threw `AttributeError`, which got caught and logged at WARNING but meant the rename-detect path never actually fired. Layer 2 walk-forward in the bridge masked the symptom (lookups still resolved correctly), but the registry would have stayed perpetually keyed to the previous version. One-character fix.
- **5.0.402**: Three follow-on registry fixes after v5.0.401 verification surfaced edge cases. `_writeEnvoyConfig` now garbage-collects dead-PID rows on every write — registries that previously accumulated dead entries across sessions (hard kills, force-quits, crashes) collapse to live-only on the next save (verified: 28 rows → 1 in one cycle). `EmbodyExt.Update()` caches `_last_toe_name` and triggers `RefreshRegistry()` on basename mismatch — defensive backstop for `execute.py`'s postSave hook in case it didn't reload. Bridge `handle_launch_td` adds a PID-aware slow-path scan after the fast-path key lookup: walks-forward each alive instance's registered `toe_path` and refuses if any resolves to the same target — fixes the stale-key + walk-forward composition that could otherwise spawn a duplicate TD. 6 new tests across `test_envoy_registry` and `test_envoy_bridge`.
- **5.0.401**: `envoy.json` registry walks forward across TD's save-time .toe version bump (`Foo-5.398.toe` → `Foo-5.399.toe`). Two-layer fix: `EnvoyExt._instanceKey` and `_writeEnvoyConfig` detect a PID's existing row under a different basename and rename + prune in one write; new `RefreshRegistry()` is called from `onProjectPostSave` so the registry walks forward even when Envoy doesn't restart. Bridge-side defensive layer: `find_latest_versioned_toe()` strips `<digits>.toe` and finds the highest-versioned sibling on disk; `resolve_toe_path()` now reads from `instances[active]` (was legacy-flat-only) and routes through the walk-forward helper. Plus a hotfix for the postSave's `'EnvoyExt' object has no attribute 'port'` crash — `RefreshRegistry()` now reads the running port from envoy.json by PID instead of a nonexistent instance attribute. 20 new tests across `test_envoy_registry` (7) and `test_envoy_bridge` (13), one updated for the v5.0.399 instance-specific guard.
- **5.0.399**: New `edit_dat_content` MCP tool for token-efficient surgical text edits — mirrors Claude Code's Edit tool (`old_string`/`new_string`, unique match by default, opt-in `replace_all`), so a 2-line edit in a 500-line DAT no longer pays for the whole DAT's content on the wire. Bridge multi-launch fix: Envoy can now launch a TD instance alongside an unrelated TD project — `handle_launch_td` swapped the blanket "any TD running" guard for an instance-specific check, macOS `open -n` flag forces a new process instead of reusing an existing window, and PID identification diffs against a pre-launch snapshot instead of returning the first TD pid found. Plus 11 new tests for the new tool and a one-line fix for `test_set_dat_content_clear` that had been failing since v5.0.397's wipe guardrail.
- **5.0.398**: Hotfix for a latent race condition that broke the first-install dialog flow on fresh-project drops without a cached catalog. `Update()` raced with `EnsureCatalogs()`, which sets `Status='Scanning defaults (X/N)'` to show progress. The old gate `if Status != 'Enabled': return` returned early on that transient value, so `_pending_envoy_prompt` was never consumed and the Envoy opt-in dialog never appeared. Both gates (`Update`, `ReconcileMetadata`) now short-circuit only when Status is explicitly `'Disabled'`. Plus 2 regression tests that fail without the fix.
- **5.0.397**: `confirm_wipe` guardrail on `set_dat_content` MCP tool blocks accidental DAT wipes from malformed agent calls (refuses `text=""`, `rows=[]`, or `clear=True` with no replacement unless explicitly confirmed); TDN at-risk dialog skips TD-managed read-only DAT types (Info, WebRTC, Folder, Monitors, device-discovery, etc.) so the warning only fires for content the user actually authored; `.embody/config.json` now byte-stable across saves via sorted iteration of `_PERSISTED_PARAMS` + `sort_keys=True` (issue #18); test debt cleanup of 28 orphan `.txt` files, 3 stale envoy_bridge stubs replaced with 6 real tests, ancestor_rename tearDown leak fixed, palette tdn_reconstruction tests aligned with current production contract
- **5.0.393**: Harden Envoy bootstrap so silent failures surface a useful textport message instead of `No module named 'mcp.server'` — `_setupEnvironment` now returns `bool`, four previously-silent failure paths log explicit errors, `Start()` aborts before `_runServer` if deps aren't ready, and a final `import mcp.server` gate catches partial installs (issue #17)
- **5.0.392**: Critical Windows-only fix — `subprocess.run` from inside TD raised `[WinError 50] The request is not supported` because TD's GUI process stdin handle isn't duplicatable, causing Embody's venv-verify to falsely flag healthy venvs as corrupt and `shutil.rmtree` them on every TD restart. Fixed by passing `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL` on the 5 affected `subprocess.run` sites in the bootstrap and verify-venv paths
- **5.0.391**: Per-project TouchDesigner build pinning (committed `.embody/project.json` + Envoy bridge auto-discovers the matching install on fresh clones), thread-conflict fix in the MCP update checker, and a 21-assertion cleanup of bridge tests that had been silently broken since the bridge v2 refactor — bridge tests now 148/151 passing, zero failures
- **5.0.386**: Batch-confirm prompt for duplicate path detection — when multiple groups remain unresolved, one dialog offers `Auto-resolve all` / `Review individually` / `Dismiss` instead of a separate modal per group
- **5.0.383**: Clone detection fix for self-referencing masters (reusable UI components using `iop.*` expressions), and a cleaner list UI moving the tree expand/collapse indicator into a dedicated column
- **5.0.381**: Global Perform Mode toggle disables Embody/Envoy/TDN compute during TD performance (Issue #13), auto-resolve duplicate DATs inside active clones without prompting (Issue #15), ancestor-rename disk handling now uses the externalizations folder prefix so `Move` no longer fails with "source folder not found" (Issue #16), new render-coordinate-system rules for TD's bottom-left origin convention (Issue #14)
- **5.0.376**: Palette scan skips invasive palettes (TDVR framerate popup, AutoUI widget dialog) on fresh-build startup, rebaked palette catalog covers TD 2025.32460, and false "locked content" warnings suppressed inside clones/replicants (Issue #12)
- **5.0.372**: TDN three-mode master switch (Off/Export-on-Save/Roundtrip), `read_tdn` MCP tool (~20-90× fewer tokens than `get_op` walks), combined DAT+storage Content Safety dialog with "Never Ask" footgun removed, palette detection fix for native `buttonCOMP` operators, migration nudge for upgrading users, docs + landing page rewrite
